Thanks to a strong commitment and great teamwork from part of its members, at some point, AEGEE-Oviedo managed to become the largest antenna in AEGEE-Europe’s history with more than 2000 members. This feat is still remembered and used as a reference of an ideal management of the association’s human resources, collaboration with the university and youth activism.</p><p>AEGEE-Oviedo has been managing for several years most of the Erasmus and exchange students activities in the region. Besides, as part of the association’s common activities, workshops and talks related to the mission and vision of AEGEE-Europe are organized, such as:</p><ul><li>Conferences about the elections to the European Parliament as part of the Y-Vote project.</li><li>Training courses on different topics, such as: mediation and peaceful problem solving, creation and management of projects within NGO’s…</li><li>Summer University Project (iconic AEGEE project, working since 1988, with the goal of facilitating cultural exchange and youth mobility).

This exchange of ideas happens in all our activities but a special place for them is our Working groups, conferences and General Assemblies (EBM &amp; Agora). </p></li><li> <p> Advocacy and policy </p><p> AEGEE gathers the opinions of European students and represents them towards stakeholders through campaigns, lobby actions, conferences and membership in bigger advocacy platforms. In addition, AEGEE informs students and young people about the impact which European policies have in their lives and opportunities they offer. </p></li><li> <p> Thematic projects </p><p> Thematic projects, either local or international, are initiatives developed by members of AEGEE. They deal with current challenges in the European society, create awareness among young people and propose solutions from a student point of view.
